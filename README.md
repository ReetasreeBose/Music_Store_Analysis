# SQL Project: Analyzing Online Music Store Data

Project Overview:
The online music store has a large database consisting of music playlists, customer data, sales records, and song information. By analyzing this dataset with SQL queries, the store can gain insights into its user behavior, sales trends, and overall business performance. The insights gained will help drive decisions about marketing, inventory management, and product offerings.

Database and Tools:
Database: PostgreSQL
Tools: PgAdmin4 (for database management and query execution)

Steps Involved in the Project:
Understand the Database Schema: The first step is to explore and understand the structure of the database. Here are some common tables you might expect to find in a music store's database:

Customers: Stores information about users, such as name, email, and location.
Columns: customer_id, first_name, last_name, email, country, etc.

Songs: Contains details about songs available in the store.
Columns: song_id, song_name, artist_id, album_id, genre, duration, etc.

Artists: Contains details of music artists.
Columns: artist_id, artist_name, country, etc.

Albums: Contains details about music albums.
Columns: album_id, album_name, release_date, artist_id, etc.

Sales: Contains records of music purchases and playlists.
Columns: sale_id, customer_id, song_id, sale_date, sale_amount, etc.

Playlists: Stores the playlists created by customers.
Columns: playlist_id, customer_id, song_id, playlist_name, etc.

After understanding the schema, we write SQL queries to analyze the data and therefore, answering business-related questions.
